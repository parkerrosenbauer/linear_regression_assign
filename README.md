# Linear Regression Assignment

The ipynb file included was created for a project for my data science bootcamp. All questions asked by the assignment are included in the file. 

Please note that the data set used has ethical problems, as the authors of the dataset created a variable, 'B', assuming that racial self-segregation had a positive impact on house prices. Using this dataset was a requirement for the project and that was why it was used.
